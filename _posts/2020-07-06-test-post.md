## Problem Setup

Our goal is to create a model which will recommend what action to take today given the previous n days of data as input. More specifically, the input will be an n-length array of normalized daily adjusted close prices for a single stock. For this basic model we will have three possible actions:
1. Sell all held stocks
2. Buy with all available cash
3. Do nothing
