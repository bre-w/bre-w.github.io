## Problem Setup

Our goal is to create a model which will recommend what action to take today given the previous n days of data as input. More specifically, the input will be an n-length array of normalized daily adjusted close prices for a single stock. For this basic model we will have three possible actions:
1. Sell all held stocks
2. Buy with all available cash
3. Do nothing

We will train a neural network from scratch using TensorFlow and the reinforcement learning technique known as Q learning.

## Q Learning

Q learning is simply a mapping of a state, action pair (s, a) to a scalar value known as the q value. This value is indicative of the expected long term reward. Given a state s, the action a which has the largest expected cumulative reward will have the largest q value. Thus, if we are able to map all state, action pairs to a q value we can act optimally by simply selecting the action with the largest q value for the given state we are in.
